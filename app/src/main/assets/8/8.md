## Why do we need the ```sudo``` command?

When you use a linux system, you will most likely need to run important commands that are only available for the new user. Now, we could give everyone the root password, but that increases the chances of the root password leaking. 

Instead, we could allow certain users, or certain groups to run a few(or all) commands as root, without them knowing the root password. This is exactly what the ```sudo``` tool lets us achieve. **Basically, the ```sudo``` command lets the root account delegate the power to run a few(or all) commands with administrator(root) privileges to other users.**

The ```sudo``` command is obviously the subject of a lot of memes, so I think most people are aware of how its actually used. This is the syntax:

```bash
sudo cmd
```

So if i wanted to see the status of ```NetworkManager``` using the ```systemctl status``` command, this is what i'd use:

But there are a few other command line arguments that are useful.

For example, if you have commands that depend on your environment, you can use the ```-E``` flag to preserve them when running the command, like so:

```bash
sudo -E cmd
```

If you actually want to check what commands you're allowed to run with the ```sudo``` command, you can use the ```-l``` argument. If i run it, this is what i get:

```bash
[h@laptop ~]$ sudo -l
User h may run the following commands on laptop:
    (ALL) ALL
[h@laptop ~]$ 
```



The ```(ALL)ALL``` means that can run any command with ```sudo```.

Another really interesting feature of sudo is that you can run a command as *any* user, not just root. You can do this using the ```-u``` flag. Like so:

So in the first line, the prompt says that the file ```/etc/fstab``` is **write-protected** , ie the user ```myuser``` doesn't have the permission to write to the file. But if there was no ```-u``` flag set, it would have deleted the file right away. 

In the following lines, running the ```whoami``` command gives the value ```myuser``` when the ```-u```  flag is set.

## Configuring the ```sudo``` command by editing the ```/etc/sudoers``` file

One of the biggest Linux memes out there is the one where you run a command, but your user isn't in the sudoers file, and thus the "incident will be reported":

#### So where ARE the incidents ACTUALLY logged?

On ubuntu/debian systems, it's stored at:

```bash
/var/log/auth.log
```



On redhat systems, it's stored at:

```bash
/var/log/secure
```



On other systems it's simply stored in the system logs(```sysconf``` or ```journald```).

### Editing the sudoers file using ```visudo```

The file ```/etc/sudoers```  is used for configuring the sudo command. But this is a very important file, and if you get the syntax wrong, you could end up with a broken system. So we have to use the ```visudo``` command to edit this file. The ```visudo``` command makes a copy of the file, and checks the syntax before saving it. 

So if you want to use the ```nano``` editor, you can use this command:

```bash
EDITOR=nano visudo -f /etc/sudoers
```

 You'll see this:

As you can see, we're using the ```sudoers.tmp``` file, not the actual ```sudoers``` file. 

### Allowing a user to use sudo

You can let a user use the sudo command, by adding the following line to the ```/etc/sudoers``` command:

```bash
USER ALL=(ALL) ALL
```

So in the case of ```myuser```, this will be:

```bash
myuser ALL=(ALL) ALL
```

So after adding this, ```myuser``` can use the ```sudo``` command:

To allow all the users in a group to use the ```sudo``` command, use this command:

```bash
%GROUP ALL=(ALL) ALL
```

### Allowing a user to only use certain commands with sudo

Let's say that you want ```myuser``` to be able to use the ```sudo```  command to only use the ```systemctl``` command, but not any other command. You can do that using this:

```bash
myuser ALL=/usr/bin/systemctl
```

With that set, ```myuser``` can use the ```systemctl``` command, but when you do anything else that requires root, we get an error message:

### Disable password prompt for a user

Let's say that we totally trust ```myuser``` to be completely secure, and hence, there is no need to ask ```myuser``` for a password when it uses the ```sudo``` command. You can do so like this:

```bash
myuser ALL= NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl
```

After setting this, if we use the ```sudo``` command:

So as you can see, the ```systemctl``` command doesn't need a password, but other commands do(and if the command isn't specified in the sudoers file, it won't be allowed to be run).
